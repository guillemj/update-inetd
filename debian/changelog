update-inetd (4.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on debconf again and try to do it properly now:

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  - Reintroduce debconf templates I abusively and mistakenly removed.
  - As a consequence, also update translations I closed in former NMU:
    Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Romanian, Italian

  [ Luk Claes ]
  - Avoid output to stdout.
  - Install lintian override to avoid getting on the wrong list :-)

update-inetd (4.27-0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * When called with --disable or --remove, call invoke-rc.d $inetd
    force-reload instead of restart -- if inetd isn't running, there's no
    reason that we should be restarting it in the process of *removing*
    services from inetd.conf.  Closes: #414485.
