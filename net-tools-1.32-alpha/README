NET-TOOLS	A collection of programs that form the base set of the
		NET-3 Networking Distribution for the LINUX operating
		system.

Package includes the important Tools for Controling the net-subsystem of
the Linux-Kernel. This includes arp, hostname, ifconfig, ipfw, netstat,
rarp and route. The commands can be compiled with NLS to support different 
Languages.

complain about binaries. Add the Output of "uname -a" and try to describe your
whole setup. Include your routing tables, your intended networking setup.

                          Release-Notes
                          -------------

You can see from the version number, that this is still not an official
release for the net-tools package 1.3. Please check the tools. The NLS
Support is currently disabled, cause the cataloug files are completely
outdated. "hostname" and "arp" are considered beta, even the man-pages are
up-to-date. route is a mess but a good start for additional AF support.
ifconfig should run, but manpage is out of date. netstat can be improved and
need to be tested.


REQUIRED
--------
The tools use /usr/include/linux/* headerfiles. Therefore you have to install
a kernelsource tree. If you have installed a >1.3.50 kernelsource you will
be able to use all the features of the net-tools. They will still run with
1.2.x kernels. It is possible to compile the net-tools with an installed
1.2.x kernelsource but it is not recommended. Each net-tool will display a
list of the version dependend features with the --version option.


N O T E:
~~~~~~~~
ipfw does currently NOT support Kernels newr then 1.3.60. In addition to
  that 1.3.x Binaries will not run on 1.2.x Systems. Dont consider this as a
  usable Version. ipfw will NOT compile with the new Kernels, remove it in
  the Makefile. If you need a program to support firewalling, then have a look
  at ipfwadm:

  ipfwadm-2.1 (or newer) from ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/

arp requires the setting of a interface (-i) with newer Kernels. It is
  important, that the device for the proxy-arp IS NOT the device the
  destination will be reached. This may happen if you use 'arp' before u use
  'route', or if u call 'arp' to proxy for foreign hosts on your ethernet.

route/netstat -r will not yet support different AF cleanly. This Release
  is intented to be a base for contributors to add the ipx/ddp/ax25 stuff.


PATCHES
-------
There is a new directory called `patches' in the distribution. Those are
some unsupported and unofficial patches for different parts of the System.
See the file patches/README for information.

If you get an warning about LITTLE_ENDIAN redefined ignore it, or fix your
/usr/include/endian.h file with patches/endian.patch.


NET-DRIVERS
-----------
Tools for networking drivers (like slattach and plipconfig) can be found in
the net-drivers package. (Soon to be released).


TODO
----
See the File CHANGES for a Documentattion of the new Features and TODO if
you want to help me improving this Package.


INSTALLING
----------
See the file `INSTALLING' for a description how to configure, compile and
install the net-tools.
