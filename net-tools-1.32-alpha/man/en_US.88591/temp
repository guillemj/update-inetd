If
.B netstat
is invoked with the option
.B -o
, additional information will be displayed behind the state info.
These informations are shown like this: "rx-retransmission byte count"
"tx-retransmission byte count" "timer state" "(time/backoff)". Timer
state may now be either on or off.  The time (in seconds)
being displayed is how long it will take the timer to expire. All these
options are subject to be removed in later releases of the NET software.

.sp
The network routing table (invoked with
.B netstat -r
) shows up the
following information:
.SS Destination net/address
The destination adress of a resolved host or hand-entered network
is displayed.  Unless the option
.B -n is given, the hosts or nets are resolved. An entry named
"default" shows up the default route for the kernel.
.SS Gateway address
If there is no Asterisk ('*') displayed - any data will be routed
to the dedicated gateway.
.SS Flags
Possible routeing flags are:
.TP
.I
U
This route is useable
.TP
.I
G
Destination is a gateway
.TP
.I
H

.TP
.I
D

.TP
.I
M

.SS RefCnt
Reference count for this route
.SS Use
How many times this route was used yet
.SS Iface
This is the name of the Interface, where this route belongs to
.PP
.sp
The device statistics table (invoked with
.B netstat -i
) displays information about the interfaces:
.SS Iface
The name this interface.
.SS MTU
Maximum size for transmission on this interface. This should be the size
of data transferred on this interface without interface specific headers.
.SS RX-OK
error free received packets for this interface.
.SS RX-ERR
buggy received packets.
.SS RX-DRP
dropped received packets (due to memory lack ?).
.SS RX-OVR
packets that we were unable to receive that fast way.
.SS TX-OK
error free transmitted packets for this interface.
.SS TX-ERR
buggy transmitted packets.
.SS TX-DRP
dropped transmitteded packets.
.SS TX-OVR
packets that we were unable to transmit.
