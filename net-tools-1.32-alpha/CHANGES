Changes for net-tools-1.1.27

	Merged the changes FvK made to his 'net040' stuff - notably
	arp -f now works.

	Added output of the various DMA/Memory address options now
	that ifmap is supported. Drivers supporting ifmap can be configured
	using ifconfig's setup for irq and I/O address. Currently this means
	PLIP, but I hope more will be added. Either that or it will get
	taken out as command line modules work. Watch this space.

	Route has an mss keyword that allows you to set the tcp mss on
	a given route, and a window keyword that allows you to 'clamp'
	windows. This is useful for amateur radio and also slow network
	drivers like the DE600 or 3c501 (use 1024-2048 or so for these)

	Added a modified version of John Paul Morrison's plipconfig program.
	I wrote my own but his was nicer!

	Changed naming scheme to avoid confusion about tools/kernel versions
	and with FvK's net-040 code.
