2000-02-29   0.5.3  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Minor cleanups; added ifup.8.ps.gz and interfaces.5.ps.gz

2000-02-28   0.5.2  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Change the dhcpcd/dhcpcd-sv stuff to refer to just
	  /sbin/dhcpcd, instead of checking for dhcpcd-sv
	  specifically.

	* Add a manpage for /etc/network/interfaces, thanks
	  to Joey Hess. Rearranged ifup(8) a bit, and
	  added some stuff to it. Also actually wrote the
	  *bold* and /italic/ handling.

	* Finally got sick of lines longer than 80 chars in
	  .defn files and added \ escaping of newlines.

2000-02-13   0.5.1  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Cleaned up some of the source.

	* Redefined .defn files a bit: added a description tag for
	  methods, and made the options list be documentation
	  for the options rather than something useful for C.

	* Added defn2man.pl, and made a manpage (generated from
	  ifupdown.8.pre and defn2man.pl).

2000-02-07   0.5.0  Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>

	* Initial release, from netbase.deb, 3.16-9
